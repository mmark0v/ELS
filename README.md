## Inspiration

As an absolute beginner in python programing I came a cross with a problem that I decided to solve with python.

As part of my daily tasks to share and popularise my website projects I use free trial accounts like SendGrid and MailChimp for my email marketing campains. 

The problem with the trial accounts is that you can add only 2000 emails in your account contact list and every time I start marketing campain I was splitting this huge email lists manually, therefore this splitting tool.

# Thanks for looking at my first project
## Any recommendation or feedback will be much appreciated
